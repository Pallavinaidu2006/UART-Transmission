# UART-Transmission
This project implements a UART transmitter on the Basys3 FPGA using Verilog, sending parallel data serially via the USB-UART interface to a PC. It is designed and tested using Xilinx Vivado, with data monitored on Tera Term . Required hardware includes the Basys3 board and a PC for serial communication.
